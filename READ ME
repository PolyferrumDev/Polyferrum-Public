If you've made it to this github, then you have my personal thanks for investing your time into helping me improve!
I really appreciate any and all feedback, since it allows me to fix TONS of things I've missed.

Suggestions or bugs? go ahead and throw those straight into Issues, even if it's positive feedback. Thanks!

Obviously this is a VERY early demo, and everything is subject to change. I'll update this readme with things I plan on
adding as I recieve feedback, or things that I already know are broken.

1) I plan on adding a system to prevent the RASER from moving objects through walls, and preventing prop flying.
2) A system of interchangable cores to change what the nailgun is capable of doing.
3) Turrets and destructible props, potentially armed drones
4) Visual overhauls for the weapons and more interesting levels
